notes

*   setting a FD to  non-blocking mode ensures that functions like read recv, accept will 
    return immediately is no event occurs

*   Functions like epoll, poll, or select play a crucial role in helping your 
    program determine whether a file descriptor (FD) is ready for an operation, 
    such as reading, writing, or accepting connections. 

*   Server socket event: When you add the server socket to the epoll instance, 
    you're interested in detecting new incoming client connections. 
    The server socket will only be "ready" when there is a new connection attempt. 
    When the server socket triggers an event, 
    it indicates that a client is trying to connect, so the server needs to accept that connection.
